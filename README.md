# About project ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project was made while I was learning and exploring NextJS. It is a productivity tool that I had quite a lot of fun while building and also learned quite a lot from this. I had used redux previously but this time was the first for using redux persist for persisting the session settings and user login.

# Problem it Solves üéØ

In recent times it has become very hard to be productive due to increase in the number of distractions that rob you of your precious time. There are several techniques that have been scientifically proven to increase productivity and focus , the Pomodoro technique is one of them. Along with time management techniques it has also been proven that listening to ambient sounds also helps the mind to increase focus. Pomozen combines these two claims to provide the user with an environment which will help them increase their productivity and also keep track of their progress by providing previous session statistics. It also provides option to maintain a todolist which will help the user to maintain a clear goal during the sessions and avoid distractions.
